# Markdown
Markdown is an easy syntax to generate HTML-code from text files. It is easy to read and write. The format is .md .

>Markdownâ€™s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like \*emphasis*. [1]

### Examples
Here are some elements shown as examples for the syntax.

Your **headers** can be written like this:

	# title 1
	## title 2
	### title 3
And read like this:
# title 1
## title 2
### title 3
Or written like this:

	title 1
	===========
	title 2
	-----------
Read like this:

title 1
========
title 2
-------------

**Lists** actually look like lists:

	- item 1
	- item 2
	- item 3
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

Or sorted:

	1. item 1
	2. item 2
	1. item 3
1. item 1
2. item 2
1. item 3
