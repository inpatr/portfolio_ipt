# Command line
First, let's compare the command line (or command prompt) to a terminal and a shell.

| Command line | Shell | Terminal |
|:-|--|-:|
| Type of interface | Interprets the command line  | Text input and output environment |
|  Interface used to enter commands, f.e. Terminal | The programm that processes commands and outputs results | A wrapper programm that runs a shell and allows to enter commands |
 
 My terminal: **iTerm**
 My shell: **Z shell**
 
 ## Cheatsheet
 

	* = wildcard, joker			
	ls = list
	cat = show
	mv = move
	cp = copy
	echo = add content
		> = overwrites
		>> = combines
	touch = create empty file
	cd = change directory
	mkdir = make directory
	man = manual (+command) 
	diff = show differences
	rm = delete 
		 -rf = delete all (content too)
	clear 
	exit

TROUBLE?!

	ctrl + c
